knotPortfolio
=============
knotPortfolio is an online system for simplifying the process of managing and
gaining insight from a portfolio of stocks. This projects will be immensely useful for my target market
of independant investors with an ACTUAL portofolio that they wish to manage on my system.
Reasons for doing so: Much less complicated
                      More efficient to go to my website for simply VIEWING  portfolio rather than 
                      the security needed for buying and selling stocks, which I am not handling.
