How will stocks work?

Basically, 

# Search for a stock, get the object from the database, and make a json object out of it.
# Read the dictionary with a .get(key,None) call, if it is none, then just hit ystockquote.
# If it is in there, then get the price and the time and date it was added.

# Get todays date as a string by calling timeHelp.dateStringForDay, if that date string is equal to the date on the object,
# Then get the time string



I want a stock price. What Do I Do to get it?

price = stockHelper.getPrice
					-----> Goes through the entire cached stocks in the stocks DB.
					if (A OK):
						then price = cached stock price
					else:
						|
						|
						|--------> Hit yahoos servers.
						if (A OK):
							then price = yahoo stock price
						else:
							|
							|
							|
							|-----> then price = zero. Try again.
